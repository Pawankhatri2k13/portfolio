By default, input is taken from keyboard and output and error messages are sent to screen.
However, we can redirect this behavior,

################
#Getting input from text file
python.py < file.txt

#Writing output to text file
python.py > file.txt
#Appending output to existing file
python.py >> file.txt

#Writing error messages to text file
python.py 2> file.txt

'''

Another powerful tool for redirecting iostreams is called piping.
Using pipes we can connect multiple commands, scripts, and other programs to make data processing pipelines.

##############################

#connecting multiple commands
#below example text is sent to translate command whose output is sent to uniq command and go on..
cat example.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
